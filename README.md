## Purdue Dietary Preference Logger
### By Alissa, Anisha, and Frances 
### Why?
The current system through which Purdue students with dietary restrictions log their requests is inconvenient for both parties involved. Students must call the dining courts, and an employee must pick up on the other end and make a physical note of their request. Our goal was to streamline this process with a webapp.
### How It Works
1. The student will visit our webapp, and input the following information:
    1a. PUID
    1b. Dining Hall they are Requesting
    1c. Time for Pickup
    1d. Food Item to be Modified
2. The student will then submit their information.
3. This information will be parsed into an email that is sent to the dining hall it is intended for.
4. Voila! A student with dietary restrictions can now easily submit their food requests.
